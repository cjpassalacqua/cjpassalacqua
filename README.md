# Hi, I'm Christian — Cloud Security Analyst in Progress

I’m transitioning into **Cloud Security & Cybersecurity**, combining hands-on AWS labs, security fundamentals, and real-world problem solving from healthcare and IT workflows.  
I’m building a portfolio that shows real technical work — not fluff.

## What I'm Working On
- Building and securing AWS environments  
- Cloud logging, monitoring, and threat detection  
- IAM best practices and identity governance  
- Entry-level SOC, cloud security, and DevSecOps foundations  
- Practical hands-on projects that mirror real security ops

## Skills & Tools
**Cloud:** AWS IAM, S3, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, VPC, EC2  
**Security:** GuardDuty, Security Hub, IAM Access Analyzer  
**Analysis:** Linux, Bash, Python basics, SQL  
**Monitoring:** SIEM fundamentals (Splunk), AWS CLI

## Featured Projects

### 🔹 **AWS Cloud Security Monitoring Lab**
A foundational cloud security architecture I built from scratch:
- CloudTrail → S3 centralized logging pipeline  
- Hardened IAM admin workflow + MFA  
- AWS CLI automation & policy configuration  
- Ready for GuardDuty and Security Hub enablement  

**Repo:** 👉 [aws-cloud-security-monitoring-lab](your-repo-link-here)

More projects coming soon.
