# Hi, I'm Christian — AI + Cloud Security Engineer (In Progress)

I’m transitioning into **Cloud & Cybersecurity** with an emphasis on AI, combining hands-on AWS labs, security fundamentals, and real-world problem solving from healthcare and IT workflows.  
I’m building a portfolio that shows real technical work — not fluff.

---

## What I'm Working On
- Building and securing AWS environments  
- Cloud logging, monitoring, and threat detection  
- IAM best practices and identity governance  
- Entry-level SOC, cloud security, and DevSecOps foundations  
- Practical hands-on projects that mirror real security ops

---

## Skills & Tools
**Cloud:** AWS IAM, S3, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, VPC, EC2  
**Security:** GuardDuty, Security Hub, IAM Access Analyzer  
**Analysis:** Linux, Bash, Python basics, SQL  
**Monitoring:** SIEM fundamentals (Splunk), AWS CLI  
**Compliance:** HIPAA awareness from healthcare background

## Featured Projects

### **AWS Cloud Security Monitoring Lab**
A foundational cloud security architecture I built from scratch:
- CloudTrail → S3 centralized logging pipeline  
- Hardened IAM admin workflow + MFA  
- AWS CLI automation & policy configuration  
- Ready for GuardDuty and Security Hub enablement  

**Repo:** [AWS-cloud-security-monitoring-lab](https://github.com/cjpassalacqua?tab=repositories#:~:text=aws%2Dcloud%2Dsecurity%2Dmonitoring%2Dlab)

### **Advanced-Microsoft-Sentinel-Attack-Simulation**
Privilege Escalation • Persistence • Conditional Access Tampering • OAuth Backdoor (Full Kill Chain)

This project demonstrates a full adversary attack simulation performed inside a Microsoft Sentinel security lab. The attack chain mirrors real-world cloud intrusions targeting Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), including: Privilege escalation, Identity persistence, OAuth backdoor creation, Conditional Access policy tampering
Suspicious sign-ins & token behavior, Multi-location anomaly generation, UEBA + Sentinel Fusion correlation
This simulation generated multiple high-severity incidents, detected through Microsoft Sentinel, User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), and Azure Activity Logs.

## My Current Goals
- Complete CompTIA Security+ exam
- Build more AWS security labs  
- Land a Cloud Security or Cybersecurity Ops role by 2026
- Strengthen automation and detection engineering skills
