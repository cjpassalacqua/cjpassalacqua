# Hi, I'm Christian — AI + Cloud Security Engineer (In Progress)

I’m transitioning into **Cloud & Cybersecurity** with an emphasis on AI, combining hands-on AWS labs, security fundamentals, and real-world problem solving from healthcare and IT workflows.  
I’m building a portfolio that shows real technical work — not fluff.

## Featured Projects

### 🔹 **AWS Cloud Security Monitoring Lab**
A foundational cloud security architecture I built from scratch:
- CloudTrail → S3 centralized logging pipeline  
- Hardened IAM admin workflow + MFA  
- AWS CLI automation & policy configuration  
- Ready for GuardDuty and Security Hub enablement  

**Repo:** 👉 [aws-cloud-security-monitoring-lab](https://github.com/cjpassalacqua?tab=repositories#:~:text=aws%2Dcloud%2Dsecurity%2Dmonitoring%2Dlab)

More projects coming soon.
